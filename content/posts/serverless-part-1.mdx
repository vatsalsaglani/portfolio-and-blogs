## Introduction

In the _Part 1_ of this blog, we will go through the steps of setting up [_AWS SAM_](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/index.html), creating a **Lambda**, and adding _FastAPI_ API endpoints.

You might have heard a lot about _serverless_ functions and their advantages so in this blog we won't be going into the explanation of, _what are serverless functions?_ or _where and when to use them?_.

In short, a _serverless_ architecture or _serverless_ function can be use when one just wants to focus on the application building part and doesn't want to get into the complexities of setting and configuring a server.

In more layman's terms, a _serverless_ architecture can be compared to **Service Apartments/Paying Guests** in the real world. When people want a place which is _safe_, _has all the basic necessities_, _has multiple accomodation options_, and _provides freedom to add some customisations_ they look for **Service Apartments/Paying Guests**. Similarly, in case of application development, if you don't want to deal with setting up servers, securing and configuring them, then serverless is the best option.

## AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)

There are many ways you can create a serverless _Lambda_ function on **AWS**. A _Docker_ container with an <InlineCode>lambda_handler</InlineCode> pushed to AWS ECR can be used with Lambda.

Or, zipping the requirements and uploading those to _AWS S3_ and then building a _Lambda_ function via the console can also work.

But AWS SAM is the best approach to have continuous integration and deployment. **AWS SAM** provides template specification to define serverless application and a CLI (command line interface) tool to build and deploy.

Moreover, we can integrate **Github Actions** using with **AWS SAM** and have a continuous development and deployment pipeline

### Requirements

To follow along with this blog you need to install and configure the following

- [**AWS CLI**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html)
- [**AWS SAM**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
- [**VS Code AWS Toolkit Extension**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-vscode/latest/userguide/setup-toolkit.html#setup-prereq)

## Creating Function

1. Open a new _VS Code editor window_ and based on your operating system use <InlineCode>cmd + shift + p</InlineCode> or <InlineCode>ctrl + shift + p</InlineCode> and search for **"AWS: Create Lambda SAM Application"** and select it

  width={1501 / 2}
  height={712 / 2}
  priority
/>

2. Select **Python3.7** or any python version you want

  width={1501 / 2}
  height={712 / 2}
  priority
/>

3. Select **AWS SAM Hello World** as the application template

  width={1501 / 2}
  height={712 / 2}
  priority
/>

4. Name your application and save it inside a folder and export the folder to VS Code

<Image
  src="https://vs-bucket-allthings.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/serverless-blog-series/Screenshot%202022-06-05%20at%205.21.18%20PM.png"
  width={1501 / 2}
  height={712 / 2}
  priority
/>

Once the folder is added to the current workspace the structure will look similar to the one in the image below

  width={1501 / 2}
  height={712 / 2}
  priority
/>

## Adding Dependencies

To create APIs or endpoints using FastAPI we first need to add the <InlineCode>fastapi</InlineCode> inside the <InlineCode>requirements.txt</InlineCode> file

```txt:application_name/hello_world/requirements.txt
requests
fastapi
```

## Writing APIs using FastAPI

Let's create some endpoints. Open the <InlineCode>app.py</InlineCode> file and comment out the <InlineCode>lambda_handler</InlineCode> function and create some endpoints as below

```py:application_name/hello_world/app.py
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World", "ok": True}

@app.get("/hello")
def hello_mount():
    return {"message": "All is well", "ok": True}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: str = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q, "ok": True}

```

## Creating Handler using Mangum

Now to handle the function invocation or various events via the API Gateway or the Load Balancer we use [**Mangum**](https://pypi.org/project/mangum/).

**Mangum** supports ASGI application frameworks like Starlette, FastAPI, and Quart. To know more about **Mangum** you can visit [this page](https://github.com/jordaneremieff/mangum)

Add **mangum** to our <InlineCode>requirements.txt</InlineCode>

```txt:application_name/hello_world/requirements.txt
requests
fastapi
mangum
```

Now let's create the <InlineCode>lambda_handler</InlineCode> inside the <InlineCode>app.py</InlineCode> file

```py:application_name/hello_world/app.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from mangum import Mangum

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World", "ok": True}

@app.get("/hello")
def hello_mount():
    return {"message": "All is well", "ok": True}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: str = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q, "ok": True}


lambda_handler = Mangum(app = app, lifespan="off")
```

## Updating Cloudformation Template

We need to allow access to all the endpoints we have created above or else we might get <InlineCode>500</InlineCode> error code in response.

To do this add open the <InlineCode>template.yaml</InlineCode> file and replace the content under <InlineCode>Events</InlineCode> with the following

```yaml
Events:
  HelloWorld:
    Type: Api # More info about API Event Source: https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/versions/2016-10-31.md#api
    Properties:
    Path: /{proxy+}
    Method: any
  Http:
    Type: Api
    Properties:
    Path: "/"
    Method: Any
```

After this update, the template file should look something like below

```yaml:application_name/template.yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "2010-09-09"
Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31
Description: >
  hello-world-lambda-python3.7

  Sample SAM Template for hello-world-lambda-python3.7

# More info about Globals: https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/docs/globals.rst
Globals:

Resources:
  HelloWorldFunction:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function # More info about Function Resource: https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/versions/2016-10-31.md#awsserverlessfunction
    Properties:
      CodeUri: hello_world/
      Handler: app.lambda_handler
      Runtime: python3.7
      Events:
        HelloWorld:
          Type: Api # More info about API Event Source: https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/versions/2016-10-31.md#api
          Properties:
            Path: /{proxy+}
            Method: any
        Http:
          Type: Api
          Properties:
            Path: "/"
            Method: any

Outputs:
  # ServerlessRestApi is an implicit API created out of Events key under Serverless::Function
  # Find out more about other implicit resources you can reference within SAM
  # https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/docs/internals/generated_resources.rst#api
  HelloWorldApi:
    Description: "API Gateway endpoint URL for Prod stage for Hello World function"
    Value: !Sub "https://${ServerlessRestApi}.execute-api.${AWS::Region}.amazonaws.com/Prod/hello/"
  HelloWorldFunction:
    Description: "Hello World Lambda Function ARN"
    Value: !GetAtt HelloWorldFunction.Arn
  HelloWorldFunctionIamRole:
    Description: "Implicit IAM Role created for Hello World function"
    Value: !GetAtt HelloWorldFunctionRole.Arn
```

## Build & Deploy

Let's build the function and deploy it. To build the function open the terminal and move into the <InlineCode>application_name</InlineCode>.

Note: <InlineCode>application_name</InlineCode> refers to the name of the application you gave at the start.

Run the following commands

1. Build the application

```bash
sam build
```

Once the build process is complete you will see <InlineCode>.aws-sam</InlineCode> folder inside your function. This function contains all the packages and files which will be required to run the application

2. Deploy the Application

```bash
sam deploy --region <region_name> \
           --stack-name <name-the-deployment-stack> \
           --resolve-s3 --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

Let's say we want to deploy it to the us-east-2 region and we name the cloudformation stack as **lambda-fastapi-deploy** our command will be

```bash
sam deploy --region us-east-2 \
           --stack-name lambda-fastapi-deploy \
           --resolve-s3 --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

Once Cloudfront finishes deploying the application to Lambda it will output the endpoint to access all the APIs in the terminal window.

## Conclusion

This blog was more of a discovery and setup kind wherein we went through the process of creating APIs using **<u>FastAPI</u>** and wrapping it into an adapter called **<u>Mangum</u>** and then deploying it as a Lambda using the _Cloudformation_ template.

In the next part, we will create a few tables inside **<u>DynamoDB</u>** and try to access them using the _Lambda_ function we created here
