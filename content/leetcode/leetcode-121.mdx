## What's the question?

<blockquote>
  You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on
  the ith day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy
  one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
  Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot
  achieve any profit, return 0.
</blockquote>

### Let's check an example

```md:input.md
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
```

Here, we are given prices for 6 days we need to tell how can we earn a maximum profit by buy a stock on some day and selling it on some another day
For the `prices` list given above we see that the minimum price to buy the stock when going from left to right is `1` and after the price `1` the maximum price which the stock can be sold for is `6` so the profit becomes `6 - 1 = 5`.

_Pretty Easy right!_ Let's translate this into some code

So, at the start we can initialize two variables `minPrice` which will be price at the 0<sup>th</sup> index and `profit` which will be `0` at the start.

Now as we iterate through the `prices` list we will have two steps,

ðŸ”µ Step - 1: Check if `price` at current index is lesser than our `minPrice`

ðŸŸ¦ If `True` at Step - 1: Update the `minPrice` with the current price

ðŸ”µ Step - 2: Update the profit

To update the profit we can find the maximum between the current profit and difference between the current price and `minPrice`. If the `minPrice` in the first step would be changed then the differene between the current `price` and the `minPrice` will be `0`. And if the `profit` is greater than `0` it will remain unchanged and even if it's `0` it will remain `0` only.

Once the end of the `for` loop is reached we return the `profit`

### Let's code it out

```py:maxProfitStock.py
def maxPrice(prices):

    minPrice = min(prices)
    profit = 0

    for ix, price in enumerate(prices[1:]):

        if price < minPrice:
            minPrice = price

        profit = max(profit, prices[ix] - minPrice)

    return profit
```
