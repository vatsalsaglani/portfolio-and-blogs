## What's the question?

<blockquote>
  Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest
  consecutive elements sequence.
</blockquote>

### Let's look at an example

```md:input.md
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
```

The task is to solve the problem in `O(n)` time. If this wasn't the constrain we could have sorted the list in `O(nlogn)` time and checked for consecutive numbers with two `for` loops.

To achive that time complexity we will loop through the numbers and initialize a `length` counter and check if `number + length` is in the given `nums` list. If it's there we will increase the `lenght` counter by `1`.

We will keep on doing this unlit there is no number like `number + length` available in the `nums` list.

Now we will take the `max` of `length` and `longest` variable and update our `longest` variable. The `longest` variable will be initialized to `0` at start.

## Show me the code

```py:longest_consecutive_sequence.py

def longestConsecutive(nums):

    numsSet = set(nums)
    longest = 0

    for number in nums:
        length = 0
        while length + number in numsSet:
            length += 1
        longest = max(longest, length)

    return longest
```
