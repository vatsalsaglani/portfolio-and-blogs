The maximum subarray problems are one of the easiest to solve but sometimes a small mistake can make it very tough and there can be a cascading effect to the whole solution, so it's better to practice every small and trivial problem out there.

## What's the question?

Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

### Let's look at an example

```md:input.md
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Subarray: [4, -1, 2, 1]
```

For this problem we will start with two variables the maxium sum or `maxSum` with value of the 0<sup>th</sup> index in list. And the sum at current index in the iteration i.e. `currentSum` which will be same as the `maxSum` while initializing them
Then we will iterate over the the remaining list and check if the number at that index is larger than the `currentSum + number` and if it is we will update the `currentSum`.
But this doesn't mean that the max sum should also be updates we will check the maximum of `currentSum` and `maxSum` and update the `maxSum` based on that result.

## Jump into code

```py:maxSumSubarray.py
def maxSum(numbers):

    maxSum = numbers[0]
    currentSum = numbers[0]

    for ix, number in enumerate(numbers[1:]):
        currentSum = max(number, currentSum + number)
        maxSum = max(currentSum, maxSum)

    return maxSum
```

Now let's check one more type of **Max Subarray** question the **Maximum Product Subarray**.

## Again, what's the question?

Given an integer array `nums`, find a contiguous non-empty subarray within the array that has the largest product, and return the product.

### Let's look at an example

```md:input.md
Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Subarray: [2, 3]
```

### How's this different than the Max Sum Subarray problem?

In multiplication we need to check of negatives also two negatives become a positive i.e. we can get a bigger positive number by taking the product of two bigger negative numbers and when that number is multiplied with a positive number the output will be more larger.

We tackle this by keeping track of the minimum number in the list as well. So let's get into the coding... ‚å®Ô∏è

```py:maxProductSubarray.py
def maxProduct(numbers):

    previousMin = numbers[0]
    previousMax = numbers[0]
    maxProduct = numbers[0]

    for ix, number in enumerate(numbers[1:]):

        currentMin = min(previousMax * number, previousMin * number, number)
        currentMax = max(previousMax * number, previousMin * number, number)
        maxProduct = max(maxProduct, currentMax, currentMin)
        previousMin = currentMin
        previousMax = currentMax

    return maxProduct
```

And we are done with this üòÖ
