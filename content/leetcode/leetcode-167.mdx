As seen in the question <a target="_blank" href="/leetcode/leetcode-arrays-two-sum-1">Two Sum in Python using dictionary</a> given a list of `integers` and a `target` integer the algorithm needs to return the indices of two numbers which can be added to get the target.
Here the only change is the given list is sorted in ascending order which can be used as an advantage.

## Two Sum II

### Question

Given an array of integers `numbers` that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number.

Return the indices of the two numbers (**1-indexed**) as an integer array `answer` of size `2`, where `1 <= answer[0] < answer[1] <= numbers.length`.

The bruteforce solution will be same as the one in the <a target="_blank" href="/leetcode/leetcode-arrays-two-sum-1">previous blog</a>.

### Solution and Explanation

```py:towsumtwo_onepass.py
def twoSum(numbers, target):


    left_ptr = 0
    right_ptr = len(numbers) - 1

    while left_ptr < right_ptr:

        current_sum = numbers[right_ptr] + numbers[left_ptr]

        if current_sum > target:

            right_ptr -= 1

        elif current_sum < target:

            left_ptr += 1

        else:

            return [left_ptr + 1, right_ptr + 1]
```

#### Explanation

As the numbers list is sorted we can use the one pass two pointer method wherein we can start with two different pointers one from the start of the list
and anoter from the end.

The logic becomes more simpler. We just need to move the pointers based on the sum of the values of their indices.

If the sum is higher than the given target than move the right pointer towards the left i.e. `right_ptr -= 1`.

If the sum is lesser than the target then we need to move the left pointer towards the rigth i.e. `left_ptr += 1`.

The only condition left is
when the sum is equal to the given target and as mentioned in the problem we need to return **1-indexed** of the two indices. Hence, we will add 1 to both
the `left_ptr` and `right_ptr`.
